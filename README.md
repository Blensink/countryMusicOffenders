Just for funsies. 

Gather a whole bunch of country music lyrics and see what words/phrases get used the most by each artist.

So far this is just a very specific web crawler that uses lxml to grab lyrics from a website and cram them into a big array.
Next up is saving all this data to a database and then do some fun analyses!
